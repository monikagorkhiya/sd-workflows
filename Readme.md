## Outline

* Who am I?
* Purpose: Focus on ambitious projects, and leave nitty-gritty to automation and tools
* Open Source.
  * How many of you have used open source software before?
  * How many of you have created or contributed to an open source application?
  * How many of you are thinking of making their project open source? Why not?
  * Advantages of Open Sourcing final year projects
    * It's a resume. Your work speaks for you.
    * Collaborating with your partners and others is easy
    * You get to use state-of-the-art tooling for free
* Programming is like writing
  * Programming is writing detailed instructions for a computer to follow.
  * Most people focus on languages, tools, and frameworks instead of patterns and processes
  * Knowing English, how to type, and how to use MS Word is necessary to be a good writer, not sufficient.
  * What else is important?
    * Understanding of the problem at hand - Know what you are solving.
    * Communication - working on a team requires communicating your ideas and understanding other people's ideas
    * Design patterns - Many smart people before us have worked out efficient ways to solve certain problems. Why reinvent the wheel? "Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it".
    * Simplicity, Separation of Concern, Performance, Security
* What does this workshop cover?
  * Process over Tools
  * Version Control, Git, and Github

### Principles of a good Web Application

#### 12 Factors ([https://12factor.net/](https://12factor.net/))

* Revision Control
* Explicit Dependencies
* Configuration in Environment
* Backing services are external
* Separate Build, Release, and Run stages
* Make application process stateless
* Export service endpoints via port binding
* Scale out by multiplying stateless processes
* Fast startup, and graceful shutdown
* All deployment environments should be as similar as possible
* Export logs to stdout/stderr
* Run admin tasks as one-off processes
